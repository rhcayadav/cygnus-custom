##<a name="section1"></a>Before starting
Obviously, you will need docker installed and running in you machine. Please, check [this](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/) official start guide.

[Top](#top)

##<a name="section2"></a>Getting an image
###<a name="section2.1"></a>Building from sources
Start by cloning the `fiware-cygnus` repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus.git

Change directory:

    $ cd fiware-cygnus

And run the following command:

    $ sudo docker build -f docker/cygnus-ngsi/Dockerfile -t cygnus-ngsi .

Once finished (it may take a while), you can check the available images at your docker by typing:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
cygnus-ngsi         latest              6a9e16550c82        10 seconds ago      462.1 MB
centos              6                   273a1eca2d3a        2 weeks ago         194.6 MB
```

###<a name="section2.2"></a>Using docker hub image
Instead of building an image from the scratch, you may download it from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/cygnus-ngsi/):

    $ docker pull fiware/cygnus-ngsi

It can be listed the same way than above:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
cygnus-ngsi         latest              6a9e16550c82        10 seconds ago      462.1 MB
centos              6                   273a1eca2d3a        2 weeks ago         194.6 MB
```

##<a name="section3"></a>Using the image
###<a name="section3.1"></a>As it is
The cygnus-ngsi image (either built from the scratch, either downloaded from hub.docker.com) allows running a Cygnus agent in charge of receiving NGSI-like notifications and persisting them into wide variety of storages: MySQL (Running in a  `iot-mysql` host), MongoDB and STH (running in a  `iot-mongo` host), CKAN (running in `iot-ckan` host), HDFS (running in `iot-hdfs` host) and Carto (a cloud service at `https://<your_user>.cartodb.com`).

Start a container for this image by typing in a terminal:

    $ docker run cygnus-ngsi

Immediately after, you will start seeing cygnus-ngsi logging traces (MySQL example):

```
+ exec /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0/bin/java -Xmx20m -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console -cp '/opt/apache-flume/conf:/opt/apache-flume/lib/*:/opt/apache-flume/plugins.d/cygnus/lib/*:/opt/apache-flume/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/*' -Djava.library.path= com.telefonica.iot.cygnus.nodes.CygnusApplication -f /opt/apache-flume/conf/agent.conf -n cygnus-ngsi

```

You can check the running container (in a second terminal shell):

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
9ce0f09f5676        cygnus-ngsi         "/cygnus-entrypoint.   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   5050/tcp, 8081/tcp   focused_kilby
```

You can check the IP address of the container above by doing:

```
$ docker inspect 9ce0f09f5676 | grep \"IPAddress\"
        "IPAddress": "172.17.0.13",
```

Once the IP address of the container is gotten, you may ask for the Cygnus version (in a second terminal shell):

```
$ curl "http://172.17.0.13:8081/v1/version"
{"success":"true","version":"0.13.0_SNAPSHOT.5200773899b468930e82df4a0b34d44fd4632893"}
```

Even, you may send a NGSI-like notification emulation (please, check the notification examples at [cygnus-ngsi](cygnus-ngsi/resources/ngsi-examples)):

```
$ ./notification.sh http://172.17.0.13:5050/notify
* About to connect() to 172.17.0.13 port 5050 (#0)
*   Trying 172.17.0.13... connected

```

You will be able to see something like the following in the cygnus-ngsi terminal (MySQL example):

Don't worry about the error, it is normal (please, see next section).

You can stop the container as:

```
$ docker stop 9ce0f09f5676
9ce0f09f5676
$ docker ps

```

####<a name="section3.2.1"></a>Editing the docker files
The easiest way is by editing both the `Dockerfile` and/or `agent.conf` file under `docker/cygnus-ngsi` and building the cygnus-ngsi image from the scratch.

This gives you total control on the docker image.

[Top](#top)

####<a name="section3.2.2"></a>Environment variables
Those parameters associated to an environment variable can be easily overwritten in the command line using the `-e` option. For instance, if you want to change the log4j logging level, simply run:

    $ docker run -e CYGNUS_LOG_LEVEL='DEBUG' cygnus-ngsi

Or if you want to configure non empty MySQL user and password:

    $ docker run -e CYGNUS_MYSQL_USER='myuser' -e CYGNUS_MYSQL_PASS='mypass' cygnus-ngsi

[Top](#top)

####<a name="section3.2.3"></a>Using volumes
Another possibility is to start a container with a volume (`-v` option) and map the entire configuration file within the container with a local version of the file:

    $ docker run -v /absolute/path/to/local/agent.conf:/opt/apache-flume/conf/agent.conf cygnus-ngsi

Of course, you can combine volumes and environment variables overwriting:

    $ docker run -v /absolute/path/to/local/agent.conf:/opt/apache-flume/conf/agent.conf -e LOG_LEVEL='DEBUG' cygnus-ngsi
